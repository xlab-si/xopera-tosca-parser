## Introduction
xOpera TOSCA parser aims to be a lightweight parser component compliant with [OASIS TOSCA]. 
The current compliance is with the [OASIS TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML v1.3].

## Prerequisites
`opera-tosca-parser` requires Python 3 and a virtual environment. 
In a typical modern Linux environment, we should already be set. 
In Ubuntu, however, we might need to run the following commands:

```console
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install -y python3-venv python3-wheel python-wheel-common
```

## Installation and Quickstart
The orchestration tool is available on PyPI as a package named [opera-tosca-parser]. 
Apart from the latest [PyPI production] version, you can also find the latest [PyPI development] version, which 
includes pre-releases so that you will be able to test the latest features before they are officially released.

The simplest way to test `opera-tosca-parser` is to install it into Python virtual environment:

```console
$ python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) $ pip install opera-tosca-parser
```

To test if everything is working as expected, you can clone [xopera-examples] GitHub repository and try to parse a 
simple [hello-world] example with the `opera-tosca-parser` CLI tool that comes along with the TOSCA parser:

```console
(.venv) $ git clone git@github.com:xlab-si/xopera-examples.git
(.venv) $ cd xopera-examples/misc/hello-world
(.venv) $ opera-tosca-parser parse service.yaml
Parsing service template...
Done.
```

And that is it. 
The `opera` orchestrator is available in [xopera-opera] repository.
For more startup examples please visit [xopera-examples] repository.
If you want to use opera commands from an API take a look at [xopera-api] repository. 
You can also take a look at the [xOpera SaaS] component, which is designed for business partners and enterprise users.
